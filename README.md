## üöÄ What is ioBroker?

[ioBroker](https://www.iobroker.net/) is a powerful integration platform for the Internet of Things (IoT), designed to connect various smart home devices, services, and systems into a unified automation platform. Adapters are the core components that enable ioBroker to communicate with different technologies and services.

## Prerequisites and Basic GitHub Copilot Setup

Before using this template, ensure you have GitHub Copilot properly set up in your repository. If you're new to GitHub Copilot, follow these steps:

### Step 1: GitHub Copilot Subscription & Installation

1. **Subscribe to GitHub Copilot**
   - Visit [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) and subscribe to GitHub Copilot Individual or Business
   - Ensure your subscription is active and includes your target repository

2. **Install GitHub Copilot Extension**
   - **VS Code**: Install the [GitHub Copilot extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot)
   - **JetBrains IDEs**: Install GitHub Copilot from the plugin marketplace
   - **Vim/Neovim**: Use the [copilot.vim](https://github.com/github/copilot.vim) plugin
   - **Other editors**: Check [GitHub Copilot documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot) for your editor

3. **Authenticate GitHub Copilot**
   - Open your editor and sign in to GitHub Copilot when prompted
   - Verify authentication by typing code in any file - you should see Copilot suggestions

### Step 2: Repository Setup & Validation

   ```bash
   # Navigate to your ioBroker adapter repository
   cd your-iobroker-adapter
   
   # Ensure you're logged into GitHub CLI (optional but recommended)
   gh auth login
   ```

2. **Create Basic GitHub Copilot Structure**
   ```bash
   # Create .github directory if it doesn't exist
   mkdir -p .github
   
   # Verify Copilot can access your repository
   # Open any .js/.ts file and start typing - you should see suggestions
   ```

3. **Verify Copilot is Working**
   - Open a JavaScript or TypeScript file in your repository
   - Start typing a function or comment
   - You should see grayed-out suggestions from Copilot
   - Press `Tab` to accept suggestions or `Esc` to dismiss

### Step 3: Test Basic Functionality

Create a simple test to verify Copilot is working with your repository:

```javascript
// Create a file test-copilot.js and start typing this comment:

1. **For Existing Copilot Users (Recommended)**
   - If you already have a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file, merge the content from this template rather than replacing it
   - Use GitHub Copilot to help you merge the instructions: "Merge my existing copilot instructions with the template from https://github.com/DrozmotiX/ioBroker-Copilot-Instructions maintaining project-specific context"
   - Add the template version reference to track updates

2. **For New Copilot Users**
   - Download the latest version of [`template.md`](template.md)
   - Save it as `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in your adapter repository's `.github/` folder
   - Customize sections marked with `[CUSTOMIZE]` for your specific adapter requirements

3. **Verification & Activation**
   - Verify GitHub Copilot is working in your repository (should show suggestions when typing)
   - The ioBroker-specific instructions will automatically be used by Copilot when working in your codebase
   - Test by opening a JavaScript file and typing ioBroker-related code - you should see relevant suggestions

### Integration Steps

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** Ensure GitHub Copilot is working in your repository before proceeding. If you need setup help, see the [Prerequisites & Basic Setup](#üõ†Ô∏è-prerequisites--basic-github-copilot-setup) section above.

**For repositories with existing Copilot instructions:**
```bash
# Navigate to your ioBroker adapter repository
cd your-iobroker-adapter

# Verify Copilot is working (should show suggestions when you type)
# Open any .js file and type: // Function to connect to ioBroker
# You should see Copilot suggestions appear

# Ask GitHub Copilot to merge the instructions
# Use the following prompt in your editor:
# "Merge my existing .github/copilot-instructions.md with the ioBroker template 
# from https://github.com/DrozmotiX/ioBroker-Copilot-Instructions/blob/main/template.md
# Keep project-specific content and add version: 0.4.0"
# NOTE: Exclude the HTML comment block at the top of the template"
```

**For new repositories (first-time Copilot setup):**
```bash
# Navigate to your ioBroker adapter repository
cd your-iobroker-adapter

# Verify basic Copilot setup is complete
# Open any .js file and start typing - you should see suggestions
# If no suggestions appear, complete the basic setup first

# Create .github directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p .github

# Download the latest template
curl -o .github/copilot-instructions.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DrozmotiX/ioBroker-Copilot-Instructions/main/template.md

# Remove the template comment block at the top (lines starting with <!--)
sed -i '/^<!--$/,/^-->$/d' .github/copilot-instructions.md

# Commit the changes
git add .github/copilot-instructions.md
git commit -m "Add GitHub Copilot instructions for ioBroker development"
git push
```

You can use the provided script to check your template version:

```bash
# Download and run the version check script
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DrozmotiX/ioBroker-Copilot-Instructions/main/scripts/check-template-version.sh | bash
```

#### Version Management for Repository Maintainers

This repository includes comprehensive version management scripts that automatically handle version consistency across all documentation:

```bash
# Show current versions across all files
./scripts/manage-versions.sh show

# Check for version inconsistencies
./scripts/manage-versions.sh check

# Sync documentation with current template version (updates dates and versions dynamically)
./scripts/manage-versions.sh sync

# Update to a new version across all files
./scripts/manage-versions.sh update 0.3.2
```

These scripts ensure that:
- Version numbers are dynamically pulled from the template
- Documentation dates stay current
- All cross-references remain consistent
- Manual version updates are no longer needed

### Automated Testing Infrastructure

This repository includes a comprehensive automated testing framework that ensures all scripts and automations work correctly:

```bash
# Run all tests (54 total tests)
./tests/test-runner.sh

# Run specific test file
./tests/test-runner.sh tests/test-extract-version.sh

# Tests are automatically run in CI/CD via GitHub Actions
```

**Test Coverage:**
- **Unit Tests**: Individual script functions and parameter validation
- **Integration Tests**: Cross-script workflows and end-to-end scenarios  
- **Error Handling Tests**: Missing files, invalid parameters, network failures
- **Consistency Tests**: Version synchronization and file state validation

**Key Features:**
- **Isolated Test Environments**: Each test run uses temporary directories to prevent interference
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Color-coded output with detailed error messages and debugging information

You can set up a GitHub Action to periodically check if your template is up-to-date:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/check-copilot-template.yml
name: Check Copilot Template Version
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Weekly check
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  check-template:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Check template version
        run: |
          CURRENT_VERSION=$(grep "Version:" .github/copilot-instructions.md | head -1 | sed 's/.*Version:\s*//')
          LATEST_VERSION=$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DrozmotiX/ioBroker-Copilot-Instructions/main/template.md | grep "Version:" | head -1 | sed 's/.*Version:\s*//')
          if [ "$CURRENT_VERSION" != "$LATEST_VERSION" ]; then
            echo "Template is outdated. Current: $CURRENT_VERSION, Latest: $LATEST_VERSION"
            exit 1
          fi
```
