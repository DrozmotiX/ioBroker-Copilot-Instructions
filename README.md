## üöÄ What is ioBroker?

[ioBroker](https://www.iobroker.net/) is a powerful integration platform for the Internet of Things (IoT), designed to connect various smart home devices, services, and systems into a unified automation platform. Adapters are the core components that enable ioBroker to communicate with different technologies and services.

## üìã Quick Start

> **New to GitHub Copilot?** Start with the [detailed setup guide](docs/setup.md) to get GitHub Copilot working in your repository first.

**For experienced Copilot users:**

1. **Use Copilot for Smart Integration**: Instead of simply copying the template, use GitHub Copilot to intelligently merge it with your existing setup
2. **Prompt Copilot**: "Merge the ioBroker template from https://github.com/DrozmotiX/ioBroker-Copilot-Instructions/blob/main/template.md with my existing .github/copilot-instructions.md, maintaining project-specific context and adding version tracking"
3. **Customize**: Review and modify sections marked with `[CUSTOMIZE]` for your specific adapter
4. **Verify**: Test that Copilot provides enhanced ioBroker-specific suggestions

**Current Version:** v0.4.0 | **Template:** [`template.md`](template.md) | **Last Updated:** September 2025
