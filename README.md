# ioBroker Copilot Instructions

> A track & traceable library of best practices for using GitHub Copilot to support ioBroker adapter development

## üéØ Goal of this Repository

This repository provides comprehensive guidance and best practices for leveraging GitHub Copilot in ioBroker adapter development. By using these standardized instructions, developers can:

- **Accelerate development** with AI-powered code suggestions tailored for ioBroker
- **Maintain consistency** across different adapter projects
- **Follow established patterns** and avoid common pitfalls
- **Improve code quality** through proven best practices
- **Reduce learning curve** for new ioBroker adapter developers

## üöÄ What is ioBroker?

[ioBroker](https://www.iobroker.net/) is a powerful integration platform for the Internet of Things (IoT), designed to connect various smart home devices, services, and systems into a unified automation platform. Adapters are the core components that enable ioBroker to communicate with different technologies and services.

## üìã How to Use This Template

### Quick Start

1. **Integrate Copilot Instructions (Recommended)**
   - If you already have a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file, merge the content from this template rather than replacing it
   - Use GitHub Copilot to help you merge the instructions: "Merge my existing copilot instructions with the template from https://github.com/DrozmotiX/ioBroker-Copilot-Instructions maintaining project-specific context"
   - Add the template version reference to track updates

2. **New Repository Setup**
   - Download the latest version of [`template.md`](template.md)
   - Save it as `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in your adapter repository's `.github/` folder
   - Customize sections marked with `[CUSTOMIZE]` for your specific adapter requirements

3. **Enable GitHub Copilot**
   - Ensure GitHub Copilot is enabled for your repository
   - The instructions will automatically be used by Copilot when working in your codebase

### Integration Steps

**For repositories with existing Copilot instructions:**
```bash
# Navigate to your ioBroker adapter repository
cd your-iobroker-adapter

# Ask GitHub Copilot to merge the instructions
# Use the following prompt in your editor:
# "Merge my existing .github/copilot-instructions.md with the ioBroker template 
# from https://github.com/DrozmotiX/ioBroker-Copilot-Instructions/blob/main/template.md
# Keep project-specific content and add version: 0.3.0
# NOTE: Exclude the HTML comment block at the top of the template"
```

**For new repositories:**
```bash
# Navigate to your ioBroker adapter repository
cd your-iobroker-adapter

# Create .github directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p .github

# Download the latest template
curl -o .github/copilot-instructions.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DrozmotiX/ioBroker-Copilot-Instructions/main/template.md

# Remove the template comment block at the top (lines starting with <!--)
sed -i '/^<!--$/,/^-->$/d' .github/copilot-instructions.md

# Commit the changes
git add .github/copilot-instructions.md
git commit -m "Add GitHub Copilot instructions for ioBroker development"
git push
```

## üîÑ Template Versioning

To ensure you're using the latest best practices and that your local copy stays synchronized with improvements:

### Current Version
- **Latest Version:** v0.3.0
- **Template Location:** [`template.md`](template.md)
- **Last Updated:** January 2025

### Version Checking

You can validate your local template version by checking the version header in your `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file:

```markdown
**Version:** 0.3.0
**Template Source:** https://github.com/DrozmotiX/ioBroker-Copilot-Instructions
```

### Updating Your Template

To update to the latest version:

1. **Check for updates** in this repository
2. **Compare versions** between your local copy and the latest release
3. **Download the new template** and replace your local version
4. **Review changes** to understand what improvements were made
5. **Test** to ensure compatibility with your project

### Automated Validation

#### Quick Version Check Script

You can use the provided script to check your template version:

```bash
# Download and run the version check script
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DrozmotiX/ioBroker-Copilot-Instructions/main/scripts/check-template-version.sh | bash
```

#### GitHub Action for Continuous Monitoring

You can set up a GitHub Action to periodically check if your template is up-to-date:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/check-copilot-template.yml
name: Check Copilot Template Version
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Weekly check
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  check-template:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Check template version
        run: |
          CURRENT_VERSION=$(grep "Version:" .github/copilot-instructions.md | head -1 | sed 's/.*Version:\s*//')
          LATEST_VERSION=$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DrozmotiX/ioBroker-Copilot-Instructions/main/template.md | grep "Version:" | head -1 | sed 's/.*Version:\s*//')
          if [ "$CURRENT_VERSION" != "$LATEST_VERSION" ]; then
            echo "Template is outdated. Current: $CURRENT_VERSION, Latest: $LATEST_VERSION"
            exit 1
          fi
```
